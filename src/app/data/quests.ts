    No name. No memory. Just a dull ache behind my eyes, pulsing like the aftermath of a long-forgotten dream.

      I grip the rope, muscles tight, jaw locked. The opposite shore inches closer. A break in the current, and I seize the moment—digging the pole deep, forcing the raft toward land.
      Wood scrapes against rock, the jolt nearly sending me overboard. I scrambled onto the bank, breath sharp, hands aching. The raft is already splintering, drifting back into the current.
      By the time I drag myself onto the far shore, the sky is black. The journey has drained me, and I don't trust the woods at night. I gathered dry branches, striking a small fire, the map beside me. Tomorrow, I'll move forward.

Halfway across, it dips sharply, nearly capsizing. Frantic, I scooped out water, fighting for every inch.
      The log collided with the far shore, jolting my bones. I scrambled onto solid ground, dripping and gasping, my makeshift boat already breaking apart behind me. Shaking from exhaustion and cold, I collapsed beneath a rocky overhang, knowing I've barely escaped disaster.

      A massive arch. Carved from stone so ancient it looks like it was born from the land itself.

Opposites, locked together.

      The inscription tells a story: the balance was broken. Light, once free, was trapped. Darkness grew, swallowing everything. The final image is an abyss, stretching endlessly into ruin.
      The wind shifted, rustling through the ruins. I exhaled, my breath steady, but my mind anything but. There are answers here. Maybe buried in the ruins themselves, maybe somewhere beyond them. But I can't shake the feeling that I stand at the edge of something vast.

      Time passed. The sun inches across the sky. I pried through toppled pillars, shifting stones, searching the ruins for anything else—another inscription, a clue, a scrap of history to anchor me in this place that already seemed to know me. Sweat beads on my forehead. The air thickened with the weight of time, my muscles burning as I heaved away a half-buried slab.
      And finally, I found it.
      Beneath layers of dirt and ruin, a deeper carving—faint, but intact. A phrase, etched long ago: *The King must not claim the seal.*
      The words rooted into me. I didn't understand them fully, but I knew this much—someone fought to leave this message behind. Someone wanted it remembered.
      A gust of wind rushed through the ruins, colder than before. The weight of exhaustion settled over me. I've spent too long here. I rose, my limbs aching, and glanced once more at the towering arch.

      I pushed open the creaking stable doors, the smell of rotted wood and mold heavy in the air. Straw littered the floor, undisturbed for years. As I stepped further in, my boot caught on something—a trapdoor, hidden beneath loose hay.
      The wood groaned as I lifted it, revealing a shallow cellar. In the faint twilight, shapes resolved slowly: bones, huddled together in a desperate embrace. A family—fathers, mothers, children—all hiding from something that found them anyway.
      I backed away, heart heavy, and retreated to a nearby house. Sleep came slowly, fitful and troubled. I woke sharply to the cold touch of steel at my throat, eyes opening wide to a silent figure standing above me, sword poised.
      No words—only the quiet command to stand.

      The stranger walked behind me, close enough that I could hear his breath, the scrape of boots against stone. The sword stayed at my back—not digging, not threatening, just there. A warning.
      We moved north through barren stone and shifting sand, following forgotten trails beneath a crescent moon. I tried speaking, my voice rough in the quiet.
      "Who are you?"
      No answer.
      "Where are we going?"
      Still nothing.
      Eventually, I spotted an ancient temple, massive and weathered, half-buried in the sand. Shadows danced at its entrance, inviting us closer.
      As we reached the temple steps, I spotted a narrow gap between pillars, a potential escape. It's now or never.

      My muscles tense, adrenaline surging—I saw my chance. Without another thought, I lunged toward the narrow gap between pillars, gravel kicking up behind me. I almost reached the shadows before Rowan grabbed my arm, twisting me sharply but without causing real harm.
      "Enough," he said softly, frustration clear in his voice but no violence behind it. "Running won't help either of us."
      He released me carefully, motioning toward the temple's interior. I hesitated, but I followed him inside. He kneeled, striking a match and lighting a few scattered candles, the dim flames flickering to life, pushing back the heavy shadows. The faint glow danced over Rowan's face, softening his hardened expression just slightly.
      With nowhere else to go, I sat down, exhaling slowly. Rowan watched me carefully, and after a moment, I spoke. Everything came out—the waking in darkness, the strange map, my empty memory. He listened quietly, lighting more candles as I continued.
      When I'm done, Rowan considered me thoughtfully, his eyes calm. "Rowan," he finally said. "My name is Rowan."
      Before I could respond, he rose, extinguishing the candles one by one. "Rest now," he whispered, leaving me alone in the dark.

  We climbed a wooded path, damp with morning mist, the temple fading behind. Ahead, a stone shrine appeared—small, ancient, edges worn smooth by countless seasons. Rowan crouched by a shallow fire pit, coaxing weak flames to life.

  "Don't know," he said, frowning into the flames. "Don't know when either. Just...seen you."
